            "The sky appears blue due to a phenomenon called **Rayleigh scattering**. Here's a breakdown:\n",
            "\n",
            "1.  **Sunlight is White Light:** What we perceive as white sunlight is actually composed of all the colors of the rainbow (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet). Each of these colors has a different **wavelength** – red has the longest wavelength, and violet/blue have the shortest wavelengths.\n",
            "\n",
            "2.  **Earth's Atmosphere:** Our atmosphere is made up of tiny gas molecules, primarily nitrogen (about 78%) and oxygen (about 21%), along with other trace gases and particles. These molecules are much smaller than the wavelengths of visible light.\n",
            "\n",
            "3.  **The Scattering Process:**\n",
            "    *   When sunlight enters the Earth's atmosphere, it collides with these tiny gas molecules.\n",
            "    *   Instead of light passing straight through, it gets **scattered** in all directions.\n",
            "    *   **Rayleigh scattering** states that shorter wavelengths of light (like blue and violet) are scattered much more efficiently and intensely than longer wavelengths (like red and yellow) when they interact with particles that are smaller than their wavelength. In fact, blue light is scattered about 10 times more effectively than red light!\n",
            "\n",
            "4.  **Why Blue?**\n",
            "    *   Because blue and violet light have the shortest wavelengths, they are scattered the most in all directions across the sky.\n",
            "    *   When you look up at the sky on a clear day, you are seeing this scattered blue light coming from all directions, making the sky appear blue.\n",
            "    *   The other colors (red, yellow, green) are scattered much less and tend to travel more directly from the sun to your eyes.\n",
            "\n",
            "5.  **Why Not Violet?**\n",
            "    *   Violet light actually scatters even more than blue light because it has an even shorter wavelength.\n",
            "    *   However, there are two main reasons why we see blue instead of violet:\n",
            "        *   The sun emits slightly less violet light than blue light.\n",
            "        *   Our eyes are more sensitive to blue light than to violet light.\n",
            "        *   Some of the violet light is also scattered away even higher in the atmosphere before it reaches our eyes, or absorbed.\n",
            "\n",
            "**In summary:** The sky is blue because the tiny molecules in Earth's atmosphere scatter blue light from the sun more effectively than they scatter red light. This scattered blue light reaches our eyes from all directions, making the sky appear blue.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Related phenomenon:** This same principle explains why sunsets and sunrises are red and orange. When the sun is low on the horizon, its light has to travel through much more of the atmosphere. By the time the light reaches your eyes, most of the blue and violet light has been scattered away, leaving primarily the longer-wavelength red and orange light to come directly through.\n"
