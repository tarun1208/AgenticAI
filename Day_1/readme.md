# Day 1 – Introduction to Generative AI

## What is Generative AI

Generative AI refers to a class of artificial intelligence models that can **create new content** rather than just analyze or classify existing data. This content can include text, images, audio, video, code, and structured data.

Traditional AI systems are designed to predict outcomes or make decisions based on input data. Generative AI goes a step further by learning the underlying patterns in data and using them to generate original outputs.

Examples:

* Writing human-like text
* Generating images from text descriptions
* Writing and explaining code
* Creating summaries, stories, or reports

## Evolution and History of AI to GenAI

### 1. Rule-Based Systems

Early AI systems worked on predefined rules written by humans. These systems were rigid and could not adapt to new situations.

Example: If-else logic, expert systems

### 2. Machine Learning Era

Machine learning introduced data-driven learning where models learned patterns from data instead of explicit rules.

Example: Spam classification, recommendation systems

### 3. Deep Learning

Deep learning uses neural networks with many layers to process large amounts of data.

Example: Image recognition, speech recognition

### 4. Transformers and Large Language Models

Transformers introduced the attention mechanism, enabling models to understand context and long-range dependencies in text.

Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on massive datasets and can perform multiple tasks using the same model.

Example: GPT, LLaMA, Claude, Gemini
